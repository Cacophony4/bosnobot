bosnobot
========

bosnobot is a Python IRC bot. It will pretty much do whatever you want it to
do. It very easy to get up and running.

Dependancies
------------

Like most software there will be some dependancy. bosnobot currently depends
on:

    * Python
    * SQLAlchemy
    * Twisted

At this point I am not 100% sure what versions it has a dependancy on but I am
running the most recent of those locally.

Current Status
--------------

bosnobot is currently in development. Right now directions will be based on
development version. Once a released version this document will be adjusted to
reflect the latest release.

Installation
------------

To get bosnobot on your local machine you will need to grab a clone of it
from GitHub. To do this you should have git installed on your system. Once
that is installed you can execute::

    git clone git://github.com/brosner/bosnobot.git

This will create a new directory in your current working directory named
``bosnobot``. You will then need to get bosnobot on your PYTHONPATH::

    export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/bosnobot

You are all set! In the future there will be a provided setup.py file that can
take care doing the installation into site-packages.

Configuration
-------------

To get up and running you will need to have a settings file read to rock and
roll. This file is a Python script that sets up the configuration for the bot.

Currently this file must be set in an environment variable,
``BOSNOBOT_SETTINGS_MODULE``. Create the file ``bosnobot_settings.py``
somewhere on your PYTHONPATH. Then you can execute::
    
    export BOSNOBOT_SETTINGS_MODULE=bosnobot_settings

The required values in this file are:

    * DATABASE_URI - This is passed to the SQLAlchemy create_engine funciton.
      You can use any database that is supported by SQLAlchemy.
    
    * BOT_NICKNAME - This will be the nickname that the bot uses to identify
      itself on the IRC server.
    
    * BOT_CHANNELS - A list of channels the bot should auto-join once
      connected to the server.
    
    * BOT_IRC_SERVER - The IRC server the bot should establish a connection.
    
    * BOT_IRC_PORT - The port on which ``BOT_IRC_SERVER`` listens on. This is
      typically 6667.

Once you have your configuration file read to go you are ready to run the bot.

RUNNING THE BOT
---------------

To run the bot based on its installation above you can simply execute::

    python -m bosnobot
